**Pathfinding Algorithm Experiment in Unity**

This project is an experiment to test Pathfinding Algorithms within the Unity Game Engine. We are specifically testing the Dijkstra and A* algorithms for finding the shortest path across various terrains cases.

**Steps to Open the Project**
1. **Download and Install Unity.**

   First, download Unity Hub from [Unity's website](https://unity.com/download).
After installing Unity Hub, download Unity version 2022.3.42f1 using Unity Hub (ensure you are using this specific version for compatibility).

2. **Clone the GitHub Repository**
   
   Clone this repository to your local machine

3. **Open the Project in Unity**

    Open Unity Hub and Click on Add and navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository and Select the folder to open the project in Unity.

4. **Project Setup**
    Once the project is open in Unity, you should see a scene named 'Sample Scene' in the Scenes folder.
    
    Case 1: A flat terrain without any obstacles.
    
    Case 2: A flat terrain with obstacles.
   
    Case 3: A 3D terrain with complex shapes.
   
    The algorithms will attempt to find the shortest path in each case, identifying the most optimal path.




   **Pathfinding Algorithms**
   This project focuses on two popular algorithms:
    
   - Dijkstra Algorithm: A general algorithm for finding the shortest path from a starting point to all other points in a graph.
   - A* Algorithm: An optimized version of Dijkstra, using heuristics to improve performance by targeting the goal point directly.

    HOW TO TEST
    Load thje scenes in folder Scenes/SampleScene.
    Observe how the algorithms perform in each terrain configuration.
